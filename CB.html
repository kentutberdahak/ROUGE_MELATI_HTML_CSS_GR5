        <h1>Chet Baker</h1>
    <p class="bio">​Chet Baker (1929-1988) was an influential American jazz trumpeter and vocalist. Baker initially gained attention for his smooth, lyrical trumpet style and boyish good looks. Baker's trumpet playing was characterized by a cool, melodic approach that appealed to both jazz and non-jazz audiences. His vocal style, though not as technically accomplished as his trumpet playing, added to his charm and allure. However, his life was marked by struggles with drug addiction, which affected his career and personal life. Despite facing personal challenges, including struggles with addiction, Baker continued to leave an indelible mark on jazz through his emotive recordings and enduring legacy.
